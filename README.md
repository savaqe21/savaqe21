### 🙋‍♂️ My name is Fabian Leśniak

I am a Computer Science student constantly seeking new opportunities to develop my skills and gain hands-on experience. My passion for technology started in my teenage years – from building my first websites to developing iOS applications. Commercially, I have worked on WordPress-based websites and PrestaShop e-commerce platforms.

Currently, my main goal is to grow in the cybersecurity field. I actively solve CTF challenges, expand my knowledge as a member of Sekurak Academy, and pursue certifications. Self-learning is a natural part of my journey – if I don't know something, I won't stop until I master it. I am constantly investing in my growth to acquire practical skills and confidently pursue a career in IT security.
